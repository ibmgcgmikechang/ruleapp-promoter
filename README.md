# ODM RuleApp Promoter

The purpose of the code in this repo is to replicate an ODM RuleApp and its supporting XOM libraries/resources from a source RES to a destination RES.

It is useful for ODM version 8.8 and before, where the XOM is not packaged with the RuleApp. Note that it does not handle recursively defined libraries.
